Yesterday, I woke up, put on my Lederhose and walked to the Baeckerei for some Gebaeck.
On my walk, I saw a very cute Hund and pet him on the head.
But then the Hund got scared and ran away faster than a BMW.
Not to worry, I had Brot to feed its owner.
Perhaps he was excited to eat a Bratwurst!
I chased the hund to the local Eltz.
The hund escaped and I was disappointed to find out that the eltz had no klimaanlage.
In Berlin, the Hauptstrasse was filled with dancers with nice Dirndels.
